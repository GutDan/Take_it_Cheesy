The app opens your devices default camera application to take a picture.
You then have to select four corners, used to reproject a potentially skewed picture to an orthogonal view.
If the lighting has significally changed from the last usage, one can recalibrate by clicking on each number once.
The optical recognition and score calculation then procedes automatically.

## work in progress
The UI is unfinished, but the core functionality is implemented and usable. Hence no release yet. You can build an .apk using Android Studio.
